Here are details on the ansatz used for VQE benchmark of MoSAIC.

For experiments on IBM's hardware:
  - For 14 qubits: hardware-efficient ansatz with chosen depth = 4
  - For 30 qubits: problem-tailored ansatz with chosen depth = 3
  - For 50 qubits: problem-tailored ansatz with chosen depth = 3

For simulations:
